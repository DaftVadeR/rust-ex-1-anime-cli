# IDEA

The idea is to make a CLI that can be neat little anime helper. 

Query the most popular anime of the week.
Check what's coming out that day.
Get the 10 most popular anime wallpapers and link them in the CLI.
Maybe popular anime news scraped from other sites?

### Simply:

- Greet
- List options
- Allow input of choice
- Check if choice is valid and reask if not
- List the appropriate results in a legible format using the rust CLI integration.
- Should be easy enough - if Prime is to be believed.
